# C
My coding experience started with the Programming language C on my Apple Color Classic running Mac OS 7. Later on at Boston University,  I continued coding in C, programming various projects including an internet-router-simulator. This repository serves as a code base for continuing my practice of the C language- a generalized approach to programming... in general.

## Hello Internet
To compile and execute a C program app, I used Mac OS' C compiler GCC to (1) create a stand alone file of the compiled code to (2) run. Use the following two commands from within the directory to run the hello.C program:
```
gcc -o helloInternet hello.c
./helloInternet
```
