# C
My coding experience started with the Programming language C on my Apple Color Classic running Mac OS 7. Later on at Boston University,  I continued coding in C, programming various projects including an internet-router-simulator. This repository serves as a code base for continuing my practice of the C language- a generalized approach to programming... in general.
